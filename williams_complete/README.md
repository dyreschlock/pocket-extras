# Williams 6809 Combination Core

![Williams 6809](https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/blob/main/pics/arcade/williams_c.png?raw=true)

<b>Robotron</b>, <b>Joust</b>, and <b>Defender</b> are some of the memorable and classic of arcade games. These were all developed by Williams Electronics in the early 80s using the 6809 cpu. <a href="https://github.com/obsidian-dot-dev"><b>Obsidian</b></a> recently brought these FPGA implementations to the Pocket. There are 3 different cores covering the slightly different chipsets. These cores have been collected into a single combination core.

Alternate versions and Rom hacks have been included when available. You can find those in the ```_alternatives``` directory.

## Set-up Note #1

As with the other pocket-extra cores, I'm not including any RBF core files. Please source them yourself from Obsidian's distributions.

Check inside the following location to see which RBF files are required:

/Cores/obsidian.Williams6809/

## Set-up Note #2

MRAs are included for the new alternatives, but they should also be available via your favorite updaters.
